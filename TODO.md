The following list contains thins I want to do
- [x] merge to main branch (v0.1)
- [x] make a release (v0.1)
- [x] create github actions (build, dependabot, ...) (v0.2)
- [x] Update documentation (v0.2)
- [x] Replace the embedded stats with `:telemetry` Thereby the stats can be handled outside of this module.
- [ ] Better test the various options like`:run_once` to ensure they work properly (v0.3)
- [ ] Why do we handle {m, f, a}s differently for run_at and run_in? (v0.3)
- [x] Move the time handling strategies to the job
